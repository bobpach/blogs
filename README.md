# We have moved!
I have moved the blogs into individual github repos to make it easier to watch only the blogs that interest you.

- [Postgres Log Export](https://github.com/bobpach/Postgres-Log-Export)
- [Postgres CI/CD](https://github.com/bobpach/Postgres-CI-CD)
- [Postgres GitOps](https://github.com/bobpach/Postgres-Gitops)

And, as always, you can find these blogs along with many more at [Crunchy Data Blogs](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog).
